# CIS-7-Final-Project
This repository is meant for satisfying Part 3 of the CIS-7 Final Project. For my group's final project we chose the Vigenere Cypher Decryption. 

We used a formula with modular arithmetic to calculate each plain text's shift in the Vigenere table. In order to decrypt it, we do the inverse of the formula.
